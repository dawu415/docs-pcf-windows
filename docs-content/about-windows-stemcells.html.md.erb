A “stemcell” is a customized operating system image containing the filesystem for bosh-managed virtual machines. When deployed, it includes a process, called the “bosh agent,” which is pre-configured to communicate with the orchestrating VM, called the “bosh director.”
The bosh agent is responsible for executing and monitoring “jobs” on the VM.

Deployments of Windows Server on PCF currently utilize a stemcell containing Windows Server 2012R2.

##Light Stemcells
