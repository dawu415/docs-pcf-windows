This topic discusses how to obtain the Azure Light Stemcell. “Light” stemcells are metadata files used on public IaaSes that enable a user to reference and deploy a stemcell without uploading it manually. The actual stemcell lives on the cloud storage service of the IaaS, and the BOSH director instantiates the VMs.

In order to use the Azure light stemcell, you must first accept the corresponding license agreement and enable it for your non-trial Azure subscription through the Azure marketplace:

1. Navigate to https://portal.azure.com and sign in
1. Select the **New Item** in the sidebar
1. Search for **BOSH Azure Windows Stemcell** in the **Search the marketplace** search bar
1. Select **BOSH Azure Windows Stemcell** from the results
1. Select the blue banner at the bottom of the page that reads: **Want to deploy programmatically? Get started ➔**
1. Read the terms of use
1. Under **Choose the subscriptions**, select **Enable** for each subscription with which you would like to use the stemcell
1. Select **Save**
