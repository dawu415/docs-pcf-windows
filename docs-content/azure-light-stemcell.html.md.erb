This topic discusses how to activate the Azure Light Stemcell. “Light” stemcells are metadata files used on public IaaSes that enable users to reference and deploy a stemcell without uploading it manually. The actual stemcell lives on the cloud storage service of the IaaS, and the BOSH director instantiates the VMs.

To use the Azure light stemcell, you must first accept the corresponding license agreement and enable it for your non-trial Azure subscription through the Azure marketplace:

1. Navigate to https://portal.azure.com and sign in.
1. In the left panel of the page, click ** + New**.
1. Search for **BOSH Azure Windows Stemcell** in the **Search the Marketplace** panel.
1. Select **BOSH Azure Windows Stemcell** from the list of results.
1. At the bottom of the section describing the BOSH Azure Windows Stemcell, click the blue banner that reads: **Want to deploy programmatically? Get started ➔**.
1. Read the terms of use.
1. Under **Choose the subscriptions**, select **Enable** for each subscription you want to use.
1. Click **Save**.
